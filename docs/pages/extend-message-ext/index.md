# Welcome to Copilot developer camp's Extend Path: Extend Teams Message Extension as a plugin

In this path of Extend, you will learn how to use Teams Message Extensions as plugins in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. You will start with a working message extension sample available in the [sample source folder here](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/tree/main/src/extend-message-ext/Lab01-Run-NW-Teams/Northwind) and run it as a plugin in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. You will also enhance the code to add some extra features. The source code utilizes the Northwind Database, providing you with the necessary enterprise data to test your plugin like in a real world scenario.

> In this lab Northwind is a specialty foods e-commerce business based in Walla Walla, Washington. In this lab, you will work with the Northwind Inventory application, which provides access to product inventory and financial information.
