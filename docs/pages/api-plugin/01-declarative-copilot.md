# Lab 01 - Declarative copilots using grounding data from SharePoint files.

In this lab you will build a declarative copilot using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. This tool is not mandatory for you to create a declarative copilot but it makes it so much easier to scaffold, package and deploy your app. 

In this lab you will learn:

- What is a declarative copilot for Microsoft 365
- Install and configure Teams toolkit for Visual Studio Code
- Create a basic declarative copilot using Teams toolkit
- Add SharePoint grounding data to the declarative copilot
- Learn how to run and test your app

## Introduction

Welcome on board to building your own declarative copilot! Extend your Microsoft 365 Copilot by simply declaring instructions and by adding skills, and knowledge. Using the same powerful AI as Microsoft Copilot, these copilots enhance collaboration, boost productivity, and streamline workflows. Tailor your Copilot to automate complex tasks and create consistent, personalized experiences. Let's dive in and make your Copilot work magic!

The app package of a declarative copilot is similar to a Teams app if you have built one before with additonal elements. See the table to see all the core elements. You will also see that the app deployment process is very similar to deploying a teams app. 


| Element                | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **App manifest**            | Describes app configuration, capabilities, required resources, and important attributes.    |
| **App icons**               | Requires a color and outline icon for your declarative copilot.                             |
| **Declarative copilot manifest** | Describes copilot configuration, required fields, capabilities, conversation starters, and actions. |
| **Plugin manifest (Optional)**   | Describes plugin configuration, required fields, and capabilities.                         |

> In this lab we will have not have the plugin manifest but you can find it in the next as we add more features to the basic app. 


## Exercise 1: Scaffold a declarative copilot from template
### Step 1: Use Teams Toolkit to create a new app
