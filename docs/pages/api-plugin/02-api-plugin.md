## Introduction

In this lab you will set up a REST API for Trey Research, a hypothetical consulting company. It provides API's for accessing information about consultants (using the /api/consultants path) and about the current user (using the /api/me path). For now the API doesn't support authentication, so the current user will always be "Avery Howard"; in [Lab ??](#) you will add authentication and the ability to access the logged in user.

The code consists of Azure Functions written in TypeScript, backed by a database in Azure Table storage. When you run the app locally, table storage will be provided by the Azurite storage emulator.
