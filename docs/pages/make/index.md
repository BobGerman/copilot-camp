# Welcome to Copilot Camp's Make Path: Make agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot

During the Make Path of the Copilot Camp, learners will construct a customized assistant tailored for a Human Resources department. The process will begin with the creation of a basic agent using either the Copilot Studio agent builder, or the SharPoint agent capability in SharePoint Online, or Copilot Studio.

In order to better understand the available options and when you should use what, here you can find a helpful table with a brief explanation of each of the options.
