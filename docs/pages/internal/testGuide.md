# Thank you for testing Code Camp

The key to successful labs is testing; the more people who try it, the more we'll find any missing steps or assumed knowledge.

The following labs are in need of testing. Please send questions and issues to the lab owner, or bring it up in the Copilot Camp Testers chat. If you add [Github issues](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/issues) or [Pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/pulls) please mention or assign the owner.
