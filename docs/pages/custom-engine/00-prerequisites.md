In this lab you will learn how to:

- Make your developer tenant for Microsoft 365 ready
- Install and configure Teams toolkit for Visual Studio Code
- Prepare your Azure environment to create required resources

## Exercise 1: Set up your Microsoft 365 Subscription

To install and run your own custom engine copilot, you'll need a Microsoft 365 tenant where you have administrator permission. Fortunately you can get one for free through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program! In the labs which follow, you'll also use this tenant to run Microsoft Teams where you can test this lab.
You will also need Copilot License to test the app.

### Step 1: Get a tenant

If you don't yet have a tenant, please join the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program?WT.mc_id=m365-58890-cxa){target=_blank} to get a free one. Your tenant includes 25 [E5 user licenses](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans?WT.mc_id=m365-58890-cxa){target=_blank} and can be renewed as long as you keep developing!

Select **Join now** to begin.
Log in with any Microsoft personal or work and school account, enter your information, and select **Next**. You will have an opportunity to choose what kind of sandbox you want; the **Instant sandbox** is recommended.

Follow the wizard and select your administrator username and password, tenant domain name, etc. The domain name you choose is just the left-most portion - for example if you enter "Contoso" your domain will be "Contoso.onmicrosoft.com".

Remember this information as you'll need it throughout the labs! You will log in as &gt;username&lt;@&gt;domain&lt;.onmicrosoft.com with the password you chose. You'll be prompted for your phone number and then the system will set up your subscription.

Eventually you'll be prompted to log into your new tenant. Be sure to use the new administrator credentials you just created, not the ones you used when you signed up for the developer program.

!!! tip "Tip: Navigating many tenants"
    Consider creating a browser profile for each tenant that will have its own favorites, stored credentials, and cookies so you can easily swtch between tenants as you work.

!!! note "You may be asked to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)"
    [This is certainly a good idea!](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/){target=_blank} Just follow the instructions. If you really must turn off MFA, [here are instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/101179/how-to-disable-the-two-factor-authentication-from.html){target=_blank}.

### Step 2: Enable Teams application uploads

By default, end users can't upload applications directly; instead an administrator needs to upload them into the enterprise app catalog. In this step you will ensure your tenant is set up for direct uploads by Teams Toolkit.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to [https://admin.microsoft.com/}](https://admin.microsoft.com/{target=_blank}), which is the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In the left panel of the admin center, select **Show all** to open up the entire navigation. When the panel opens, select Teams to open the Microsoft Teams admin center.

3Ô∏è‚É£ In the left of the Microsoft Teams admin center, open the Teams apps accordion. Select **Setup Policies**, you will see a list of App setup policies. Then, select the **Global (Org-wide default) policy**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure the first switch, **Upload custom apps** is turned **On**.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Be sure to scroll down and select the **Save** button to persist your change.

> The change can take up to 24 hours to take effect, but usually it's much faster.

## Exercise 2: Install Teams Toolkit and prerequisites

You can complete these labs on a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine, but you do need the ability to install the prerequisites. If you are not permitted to install applications on your computer, you'll need to find another machine (or virtual machine) to use throughout the workshop.

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

It should be no surprise that **Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** requires Visual Studio Code! You can download it here: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){target=_blank}.

### Step 2: Install NodeJS

NodeJS is a program that allows you to run JavaScript on your computer; it uses the open source "V8" engine, which is used in popular web browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. You will need NodeJS to run the web server code used throughout this workshop.

Browse to [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/){target=_blank} and install version 20.x, the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for your operating system. This lab has been tested using NodeJS version 18.16.0. If you already have another version of NodeJS installed, you may want to set up the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm){target=_blank} (or [this variation](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows){target=_blank} for Microsoft Windows), which allows you to easily switch Node versions on the same computer.

### Step 3: Install Teams Toolkit

These labs are based on [Teams Toolkit version 5.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension){target=_blank}.
Follow the steps as shown in the screen shot below.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Visual Studio Code and click on the Extensions toolbar button

2Ô∏è‚É£ Search for "Teams" and locate Teams Toolkit

3Ô∏è‚É£ Click **Install**

!!! note "If you have Teams Toolkit installed but hidden"
    If you previously installed Teams Toolkit, and then hid it on the Visual Studio sidebar, you might wonder why you can't see it. Right-click on the left sidebar and check off Teams Toolkit to bring it back into view.

## Exercise 3: Get an Azure subscription

To complete the exercises in Path B, you'll need an Azure subscription to create resources on Azure. If you don't have Azure subscription yet, you can activate an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0044p) that offers $200 in credits which can be used within the first 30 days on most Azure services.

### Step 1: Create an Azure free account

Follow the steps to activate an Azure free account:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0044p) page and select **Activate**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Login with an account of your choice, it's recommended to use the Microsoft 365 tenant account you would like to use in the exercises.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check the boxes for Privacy Statement, then select **Next**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Provide a mobile phone number for identity verification step.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Provide payment details for a temporary authorization. You won‚Äôt be charged unless you move to pay-as-you-go pricing. Then, select **Sign up**.

!!! tip "Tip: Managing Azure resources after 30 days"
    Azure free account will be available only for 30 days. Make sure you don't have any services running in your free subscription at the end of 30 days. If you want to continue using Azure services at the end of 30 days, you must upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription by removing the spending limit. This allows continued use of the Azure free account and select free services for the term.
