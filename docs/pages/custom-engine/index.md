# Welcome to Copilot Camp's Path B: Build your own copilot

During Path B of the Copilot Camp, learners will develop a custom AI chatbot specifically designed to handle complex career-related tasks and workflows for a Human Resources department. The journey starts with building a basic custom engine copilot using Teams Toolkit and Azure OpenAI. Learners will then integrate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to interact with business data, apply UI enhancements to make the chatbot look and feel like a Copilot experience, enable single sign-on, and use Microsoft Graph to incorporate Microsoft 365 data. This sophisticated AI chatbot will utilize custom AI models and an orchestrator to meet the unique needs of the Human Resources department.
