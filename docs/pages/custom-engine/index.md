# Welcome to Copilot Camp's Path B: Build your own copilot

During Path B of the Copilot Camp, you will develop a custom engine copilot specifically designed to help Human Resources departments manage resumes, create new job posts and more.

!!! tip "What is a custom engine copilot?"
    Custom engine copilots are chatbots powered by Generative AI, designed to provide sophisticated conversational experiences. Custom engine copilots are built using the Teams AI library, which provides comprehensive AI functionalities, including managing prompts, actions, and model integration as well as extensive options for UI customization. This ensures that your chatbots leverage the full range of AI capabilities while delivering a seamless and engaging experience aligned with Microsoft platforms.

The journey starts with building a basic custom engine copilot using Teams Toolkit, Teams AI library and Azure OpenAI. Then, you will implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that provides ability to search across diverse resumes, apply UI enhancements to make the chatbot look and feel like a Copilot experience, finally you will enable authentication to secure your custom engine copilot and use Microsoft Graph to incorporate Microsoft 365 data. This sophisticated custom engine copilot will utilize custom AI models and an orchestrator to meet the unique needs of the Human Resources department.
