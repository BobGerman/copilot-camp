> These samples and labs are intended for instructive and demonstration purposes and are not intended for use in production. Do not put them into production without upgrading them to production quality.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To extend Copilot for Microsoft 365, you must ensure that your development environment meets the [requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites).

## Exercise 1: Enable Teams application uploads

By default, end users can't upload applications directly; instead an administrator needs to upload them into the enterprise app catalog. In this step you will ensure your tenant is set up for direct uploads by Teams Toolkit.
a. Navigate to [https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/){target=_blank}, which is the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
b. In the left panel of the admin center, select "Show all" to open up the entire navigation. When the panel opens, select Teams to open the Microsoft Teams admin center.
c. In the left of the Microsoft Teams admin center, open the Teams apps accordion 1Ô∏è‚É£ and select Setup Policies 2Ô∏è‚É£. You will see a list of App setup policies. Select the Global (Org-wide default) policy 3Ô∏è‚É£.

d. Ensure the first switch, "Upload custom apps" is turned On.

e. Be sure to scroll down and select the "Save" button to persist your change.

> The change can take up to 24 hours to take effect, but usually it's much faster.

## Exercise 2: Install Teams Toolkit and prerequisites
You can complete these labs on a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine, but you do need the ability to install the prerequisites. If you are not permitted to install applications on your computer, you'll need to find another machine (or virtual machine) to use throughout the workshop.

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

It should be no surprise that [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](){target=_blank} requires Visual Studio Code! You can download it here: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){target=_blank}.

<cc-lab-end-step lab="e0" exercise="2" step="1" />

### Step 2: Install NodeJS

NodeJS is a program that allows you to run JavaScript on your computer; it uses the open source "V8" engine, which is used in popular web browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. You will need NodeJS to run the web server code used throughout this workshop.

Browse to [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/){target=_blank} and install version 20.x, the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for your operating system. This lab has been tested using NodeJS version LTS.

???+ tip "If you need more than one version of NodeJS"
    Browse to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for your operating system. This lab has been tested using NodeJS version 18.x and 20.x. If you already have another version of NodeJS installed, or want future flexibility to change Node versions, you may want to set up the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm){target=_blank} (or [this variation](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Microsoft Windows), which allows you to easily switch Node versions on the same computer.

<cc-lab-end-step lab="e0" exercise="2" step="2" />

### Step 3: Install Teams Toolkit

These labs are based on the latest general available version of [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension){target=_blank}.
Follow the steps as shown in the screen shot below.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Visual Studio Code and click on the Extensions toolbar button

2Ô∏è‚É£ Search for "Teams" and locate Teams Toolkit

3Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Install"

![Open the App setup policies](../../assets/images/extend-m365-copilot-00/install-ttk.png)

!!! note "If you have Teams Toolkit installed but hidden"
    If you previously installed Teams Toolkit, and then hid it on the Visual Studio sidebar, you might wonder why you can't see it. Right-click on the left sidebar and check off Teams Toolkit to bring it back into view.

<cc-lab-end-step lab="e0" exercise="2" step="3" />
    
Now you are all set to create your first extensibility feature for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Proceed to create a Declarative Copilot in the next lab.
