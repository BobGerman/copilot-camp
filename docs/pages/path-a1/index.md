# Welcome to Copilot Camp's Path A1: Extend Copilot for Microsoft 365
During Path A of the Copilot Camp, learners will construct a customised assistant tailored for a Human Resource department. The process will begin with the creation of a basic declarative Copilot and progress towards developing fully skilled assistant. This advanced assistant will be equipped with security features, including authentication mechanism linked to the Microsoft 365 tenant to get orgnaisational data.
