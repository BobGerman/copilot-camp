Welcome to Copilot Camp! This is a work in progress, but some of the labs are ready for testing.

Copilot Camp is a virtual workshop for professional developers who want to learn how to build Copilot for Microsoft 365 extensions including plugins, declarative copilots, and custom engine copilots. It all begins with hands-on labs, but over time we will add instructional material, videos, graphics, and more!

We really appreciate your feedback!! Please use the [issues list](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/issues) to share your comments and issues!
