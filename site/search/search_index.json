Extend your Microsoft 365 Copilot by simply declaring instructions and by adding skills, and knowledge. Using the same powerful AI as Microsoft Copilot, these copilots enhance collaboration, boost productivity, and streamline workflows. Tailor your Copilot to automate complex tasks and create consistent, personalized experiences. Let's dive in and make your Copilot work magic!</p> <p>The app package of a declarative copilot is similar to a Teams app if you have built one before with additonal elements. See the table to see all the core elements. You will also see that the app deployment process is very similar to deploying a teams app. </p> Element Description App manifest Describes app configuration, capabilities, required resources, and important attributes. App icons Requires a color and outline icon for your declarative copilot. Declarative copilot manifest Describes copilot configuration, required fields, capabilities, conversation starters, and actions. Plugin manifest (Optional) Describes plugin configuration, required fields, and capabilities. <p>In this lab we will have not have the plugin manifest but you can find it in the next as we add more features to the basic app. </p>"},{"location":"pages/path-a1/declarative-copilot/#exercise-1-set-up-your-microsoft-365-subscription","title":"Exercise 1: Set up your Microsoft 365 Subscription","text":"<p>To install and run your own declarative copilot, you'll need a Microsoft 365 tenant where you have administrator permission.
